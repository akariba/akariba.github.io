Got it — Option B it is. You do the clicks in the browser, then upload the exports + screenshots here, and I’ll generate the final DOCX implementation report and return it together with the .msapp.

Also confirmed: I will never ask for passwords, and if you ever hit Microsoft login/MFA you should complete it yourself (and you don’t need to tell me anything sensitive).

1) DOCX template (ready)
I generated a Word template in the workspace:

ProductsApp_Implementation_Report_TEMPLATE.docx
If you want, upload your screenshots and tenant/environment info and I’ll skip the template and produce the final polished DOCX directly.

2) What I need from you (upload/paste)
Please upload all of the following:

A) Files to upload
Exported app: ProductsApp.msapp
Screenshots (PNG/JPG):
StartScreen showing GO
ProductListScreen showing the gallery of products
ProductDetailScreen showing details + image
Dataverse Products table showing columns + 5 rows (data grid)
Share dialog showing dpalka added
B) Text to paste
Tenant domain (e.g., something.onmicrosoft.com)
Environment name (from the environment picker)
3) Quick verification before you export
Just make sure these are true (so the report matches the assignment):

Gallery Items = Products (Dataverse table), not Accounts/Contacts.
Detail screen image control is bound to the selected record’s ImageURL.
Navigation works:
StartScreen GO → ProductListScreen
Select product → ProductDetailScreen
App is shared with dpalka (Role: User).
4) After you upload
I will:

Embed the screenshots into a completed DOCX report with all required sections
Reference the exact tenant + environment you paste
Return both attachments: final .docx + your .msapp
Send the tenant domain + environment name first if you already have them; otherwise just upload the screenshots + .msapp when ready.
